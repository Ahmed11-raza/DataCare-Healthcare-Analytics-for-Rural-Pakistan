> A data analytics project demonstrating healthcare access analysis for rural Pakistani districts. Created for my University of Messina BSc Data Analytics application.

## 📊 Project Overview

**DataCare** analyzes simulated district-level healthcare data to identify access challenges and prioritize interventions. This project shows my ability to:

- Work with real-world data patterns
- Perform statistical analysis and correlations
- Create predictive models
- Generate actionable insights
- Communicate findings through visualizations

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Coming from Pakistan, I've seen how data gaps contribute to healthcare inequalities. This project applies data analytics to:
1. Identify districts with critical healthcare access issues
2. Analyze factors affecting health outcomes
3. Predict areas needing urgent intervention
4. Provide data-driven recommendations for resource allocation

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components:
1. **HealthcareDataAnalyzer** - Data processing and analysis
2. **DataVisualizer** - Creation of charts and reports
3. **DataStoryteller** - Insight generation and reporting
4. **Predictive Models** - Simple regression-based predictions

### Key Analyses:
- Healthcare access scoring (composite index)
- Correlation analysis between infrastructure and outcomes
- District prioritization for interventions
- Predictive modeling of health outcomes

### Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.8+** - Core programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Statistical Analysis** - Correlation, regression, clustering concepts

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed11-raza/datacare.git
cd datacare

# Run the analysis
python datacare.py
